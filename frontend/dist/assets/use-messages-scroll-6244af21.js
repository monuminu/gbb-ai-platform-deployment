Your task is to classify each query into one of the following intent categories:

Information Request (IR) - When the user is seeking information.
Action Request (AR) - When the user wants to perform an action.
Feedback/Complaint (FC) - When the user is providing feedback or making a complaint.
Other (O) - When the user query doesn't fit into any of the above categories.

Examples:

"What's the weather like today?" - IR
"Can you book a table for two at the Italian restaurant?" - AR
"The app keeps crashing whenever I try to open it." - FC
"Hello!" - O

Dataset:

"How do I reset my password?"
"I need to cancel my subscription."
"Your recent update has a lot of bugs."
"Tell me a joke."
Instructions:

For each query in the dataset, determine the intent category it belongs to.
